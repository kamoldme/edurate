### Problem Solved

**Before**: Teachers couldn't see reviews until admin approved them
**After**: Teachers see ALL reviews immediately with status indicators

### Backend Changes

**File**: `routes/dashboard.js:94-106`

```javascript
// Teachers now receive ALL reviews (approved + pending)
const recentReviews = db.prepare(`
  SELECT r.*, r.flagged_status, r.approved_status, ...
  FROM reviews r
  WHERE r.teacher_id = ?
  ORDER BY r.created_at DESC
`).all(teacher.id);
```

**Visual Indicators**:
- ⏳ Yellow badge: "Pending Approval"
- ✅ No badge: Approved
- 🚩 Red badge: "Flagged"
- ❌ Gray badge: "Rejected"

**Warning Banner**:
```
⏳ 5 Reviews Pending Approval
These reviews are visible to you but awaiting admin approval
before being included in your official scores.
```

**Visual Styling**:
- Pending reviews: 70% opacity + yellow left border
- Separated count: "(12 approved, 5 pending)"

**Important**: Only **approved** reviews count toward official scores/averages!

## 6️⃣ **Practical Workflows for New Schools**

### Scenario 1: Initial Setup (New School)

1. **Admin creates term**: "Fall 2024"
2. **Admin creates teachers**: Bulk or individual
3. **Teachers create classrooms**: Using their accounts
4. **Students join**: Via join codes
5. **Feedback period opens**: Admin activates
6. **Students submit reviews**: All reviews visible to teachers immediately
7. **Admin reviews moderation queue**: Click "Approve All (50)" for clean reviews
8. **Teachers see final scores**: Scores update automatically

**Time Saved**: Bulk approval saves ~10 seconds per review = **8+ minutes for 50 reviews**

---

### Scenario 2: Teacher Made a Mistake

**Problem**: Teacher created "Matematics" instead of "Mathematics"

**Solution**:
1. Admin → Classrooms
2. Find classroom
3. Edit subject to "Mathematics"
4. ✅ Fixed in 10 seconds

**Before This Feature**: Teacher would have to:
- Delete classroom (lose all student memberships)
- Recreate classroom (new join code)
- Have all students rejoin
- ⏱️ 20+ minutes wasted

---

### Scenario 3: Student Can't Access Review

**Problem**: Student says "I submitted a review but my teacher doesn't see it"

**Old Behavior**: Teacher couldn't see pending reviews → confusion

**New Behavior**:
1. Teacher logs in
2. Sees review with "⏳ Pending Approval" badge
3. Can tell student: "I see it! Just waiting for admin approval"
4. ✅ Clear communication

---

### Scenario 4: User Forgot Password

**Problem**: Teacher/student forgot password

**Solution**:
1. Admin → Users
2. Click "Reset PW" for that user
3. Enter new password (min 8 chars)
4. Give password to user
5. ✅ Done in 30 seconds

**Logged**: Admin action, timestamp, IP address

---

## 🔐 Security & Data Integrity

### Email Uniqueness
- Changing user email checks for conflicts
- Returns 409 error if email already in use

### Cascading Updates
- Updating teacher name updates both `teachers` and `users` tables
- Ensures data consistency

### Audit Trail
- Every admin action logged with:
  - Who did it (admin user ID + name)
  - What changed (before/after values in metadata)
  - When (timestamp)
  - Where from (IP address)

### Authorization
- All endpoints require admin role
- Some endpoints allow school_head (read-only operations)
- JWT token validation on every request
